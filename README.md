This is a Library Management System, built using Java
<br>
To run the program successfully, first create a folder in called "Library Management System" at the address C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents
<br>
Or you can just make the files default by replacing file address with only file name in line  164, 165, 166:
<br>
 164    File bookFile = new File("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\Library Management System\\books.txt");
           <br>
 165    File orderFile = new File("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\Library Management System\\orders.txt");
          <br>
  166    File issuedBookFile = new File("C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\Library Management System\\issued books.txt")
           <br>
 Replace the above lines by:
 <br>
 164    File bookFile = new File("books.txt");
            <br>
 165    File orderFile = new File("orders.txt");
            <br>
<p class = "tab-space" >  166    File issuedBookFile = new File("issued books.txt");
